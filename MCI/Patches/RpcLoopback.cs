///     Makes client-targeted RPCs reach MCI's bots.
///     <para>
///         A targeted RPC is written as a message addressed to a client id and handed to the server, which relays it to
///         the socket owning that id. MCI's bots have a <see cref="ClientData" /> entry but nothing behind it, so every
///         such message is written to the wire and lost - which is why role assignments, per-player syncs and anything
///         else a mod sends to one player have never applied to a bot.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Every bot lives in this process and shares the same <see cref="InnerNetObject" /> graph as the real client, so
///         "delivering" one of these messages is just running its handler here. This intercepts messages aimed at a bot
///         and dispatches them locally instead of sending them.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Broadcast RPCs are deliberately left alone: the host already applies those locally before sending, so looping
///         them back would run every one of them twice.
